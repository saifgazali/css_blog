 <p> <div class="post">BEIJING: China's sole aircraft carrier has returned home following a far-ranging three-week training mission during which its combat capabilities were closely scrutinized and speculation soared over what future role the flat-top will play amid China's growing military ambitions.</div>
<div class = "day">The Defense Ministry said the 60,000-ton Liaoning sailed in to the eastern port of Qingdao on Friday along with its battle group that includes destroyers, frigates, a supply ship and anti-submarine craft.
The ministry quoted the group's commander, Rear Adm. Chen Yueqi, as saying the drill simulated real combat as closely as possible and "achieved all targets set for it." China commissioned the carrier in 2012 and declared it combat ready in November, shortly after which it launched its first live-fire exercises.</div>
<div class="jan">The cruise that began on Christmas Day took it through the Miyako Strait, south of Okinawa, Japan, and then the Bashi Channel separating Taiwan from the Philippines as it entered the disputed South China Sea that China claims virtually in its entirety.
It headed home through the Taiwan Strait in what was seen by many as a threatening message to the island's independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it was closely monitoring the passage but that there was no cause for alarm.

 <h2>this is my second article</h2>
<p><div class="post">I attended my IAS Interview on 17th March, 2016 at UPSC Bhawan, Dholpur House, New Delhi, and faced a number of “weird” questions within a span of 30 minutes. Some of those excerpts from my interview are -
“What would you do if you were asked to calculate the distance between Kolkata and Delhi, sitting in this room? Assume that you don’t have access to internet, map or any travel ticket.”
(Answer - Distance = Speed of train * Time of travel)</div>
<div class = "day">
The question was asked specifically because I had mentioned about travelling by train from Kolkata to reach Delhi.
I was wearing formal shirt and trousers that day, and skipped the tie. Hence the questions - 
(a)“Why are you not wearing a tie?”
(b) “Why do you think people wear a tie?”
(c) “What would you say if a person walks into his interview room, wearing a ‘lungi’?” I answered ‘It would be improper’. 
(d) “What is the problem with wearing a ‘lungi’ in the interview room, when Mr P Chidambaram can wear it even during international summits?” (Totally stumped!)
This was my first official interview in life, and I was totally stumped by the UPSC Interview Board with these questions. Somehow managed to scrape through to the final Merit List, though!
P.S. There are many rumours surrounding IAS Interviews regularly doing the rounds in social media, where numerous ridiculous questions are claimed to have been asked in the IAS Interviews. A few examples are -
“How can you lift an elephant with one hand?”</div>
<div class="jan">
What looks like half apple ?
Bay of Bengal is in which state?
These are absolutely ridiculous and baseless things which have NEVER been asked in ANY IAS Interview in the history of the exam. UPSC Boards may ask ‘weird’ questions like the ones I have mentioned from my experience, but baseless questions like these are never in the picture.
EDIT : My answer to question “Why are you not wearing a tie?” - There is no dress code prescribed for UPSC Interviews. I have never worn a tie in my life, and hence thought it would not be a good idea to try something fancy on this big day.
Had escaped the ‘lungi’ tirade by saying that I am unaware of South Indian traditions and customs relating to attire. Interviewer seemed to be amazed at the fact that i had ‘never visited’ South India. Even I was amazed by his amazement at that! :P
